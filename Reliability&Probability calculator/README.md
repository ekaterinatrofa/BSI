#### Exercise 3:
```
An industrial machine compresses natural gas into an interstate gas pipeline. The 
compressor is on line 24 hours a day. (If the machine is down, a gas field has to be shut 
down until the natural gas can be compressed, so down time is very expensive.) The vendor knows that the compressor has a constant failure rate of 0.000001 failures/hr. What is the 
operational reliability after 2500 hours of continuous service?

Answer: 
Reliability = 0.9975 or 99.75% 
```
#### Exercise 4:
```
What is the highest failure rate for a product if it is to have a reliability (or probability of 
survival) of 98 percent at 5000 hours? Assume that the time to failure follows an 
exponential distribution.

Answer: 
λ = 0.00000404 f/hr 
```
#### Exercise 5:
```
Suppose that a component we wish to model has a constant failure rate with a mean time 
between failures of 25 hours? Find:

(a) The reliability function. 

(b) The reliability of the item at 30 hours.

Answer: 
(a) λ = 0.04
    R(t) = e^-(0.04*t)
(b) Reliability = 0.3012
```

#### Exercise 6:
```
The equipment in a packaging plant has a MTBF of 1000 hours. What is the probability that 
the equipment will operate for a period of 500 hours without failure?

Answer: 
 
The probability is 61%.
